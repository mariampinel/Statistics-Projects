# Statistics Projects - QMUL Coursework

This repository contains the code and analysis for three distinct statistical projects completed as part of the **Statistics** course at **Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)**. The projects involve data manipulation, statistical analysis, and modeling across various domains, including demographic data, bridge condition prediction, and property price changes. Below is a summary of each project and the objectives achieved.

## **Project 1: Analysis of ‘Lower Layer Super Output Areas’ (LSOA) in the UK**

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing demographic data for LSOAs in the UK. The goal is to explore the age distribution in different areas and identify unusual patterns. The key components of the analysis include:

- **Part 1:** Created a **Bar Chart** to visualize the age profile for different LSOAs.
- **Part 2:** Analyzed the **distribution of younger, older, and median ages** within each LSOA.
- **Part 3:** Compared **median age distributions** across different area types (urban, rural, etc.).
- **Part 4:** Identified and classified **unusual areas by proportions** of age groups, helping to spot outliers and trends.

## **Project 2: Predicting Bridge Conditions from Texas Bridge Data**

In this project, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the Texas bridge dataset, aiming to predict the condition of bridges based on various predictor variables. The report was designed for a specialist in **metal corrosion** and **concrete deterioration** at the Texas Department of Transportation. Key activities in the analysis included:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the relationships between continuous and categorical variables in the dataset.
- **Regression Modeling:** Developed regression models to understand how predictor variables affect the target variable — **bridge condition**.
- **Key Insight:** The report highlights which variables have the most influence on predicting bridge condition, providing actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance.

## **Project 3: Examining UK Property Price Changes and Debunking False Causality**

This project involves investigating property price changes in the UK, with a focus on testing a potential spurious causality relationship between property prices and external factors. The key tasks included:

- **Task 1:** Used a **chi-square test** and a **permutation test** to examine if property price changes are independent of the region.
- **Task 2:** Applied the **bootstrap method** to calculate confidence intervals and compare various **regression models**, exploring the confusion surrounding p-values and testing the claim in the classic paper "Storks Deliver Babies" by Robert Matthews.

## **Final Report**

The final report consolidates the findings from each of the projects, including detailed explanations of the methods used, the statistical tests performed, and the conclusions drawn. It also contains all the code used for data analysis and modeling, as well as visualizations (e.g., bar charts, regression plots, etc.) to support the findings.
