# Statistics-Projects
## Projects from QMUL 

**Project 1:** Manipulate, review and plot results for ‘lower layer super output areas’ (LSOA) in the UK
- Part 1: Bar Chart of the Age Profile
- Part 2: Distribution of the Younger, Older and Median Ages in Each LSOA
- Part 3: Comparing the Median Age Distributions by Area Type
- Part 4: Classification of Unusual Areas by Proportions

**Project 2:** Report on prediction of bridge conditions from Texas Bridge data 
- Carry out an exploratory analysis of data with both continuous and categorical variables
- Use regression modelling to look at the effect of predictor variables on a target
variable- bridge condition- and present which of the proposed variables has more influence on the current bridge condition.
Objective: The report is to be submitted to a representative of the Texas Department of Transportation.
She is a specialist in metal corrosion and the deterioration of concrete and wants to understand “what the data says” but also “how it has been processed”.


**Project 3:** Examine UK property price changes & de-bunk a false causality relationship
- Task 1: Using data on property prices, examine some price changes to test for
independent of the region using a chi-square test and a permutation test.
- Task 2: Using a dataset on a classic paper on confusion about p-values,  “Storks Deliver Babies (p = 0.008)” by Robert Matthews, use the bootstrap method to calculate confidence intervals and compare different regression models.
